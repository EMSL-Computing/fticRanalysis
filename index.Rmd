# fticRanalysis

The `fticRanalysis` package was designed to help with various steps of processing FTICR data, including:

* data formatting and manipulation
* reproducible analysis pipeline
* filtering data based on various properties
* calculating meta information for each peak (e.g. NOSC)
* data visualization and summary
* one sample
* multiple samples
* group comparisons

The `fticRanalysis` package was developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (http://www.pnnl.gov). See here for more information: https://msc-viz.emsl.pnnl.gov.
